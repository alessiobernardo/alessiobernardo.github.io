### C-SMOTE: Continuous Synthetic Minority Oversampling for Evolving Data Streams 
A Bernardo, H M Gomes, J Montiel, B Pfahringer, E Della Valle, A Bifet. IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), 2020. [DOI](10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9377768)

A new meta-strategy for rebalancing imbalanced data streams in case of concept drift. It uses one element at time to update the model and it continuously rebalances the stream using a modified version of the well known SMOTE technique.

### Incremental Rebalancing Learning on Evolving Data Streams
A Bernardo, E Della Valle, A Bifet. IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW), 2020. [DOI](10.1109/ICDMW51313.2020.00121)
 
An algorithm for rebalancing imbalanced evolving data streams. It trains four models in parallel, of which, two of them are trained on a rebalanced batch of data. The best model is then used in the prediction phase. [Access Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349421873_Incremental_Rebalancing_Learning_on_Evolving_Data_Streams)
